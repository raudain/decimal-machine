# Program number  1:
# This program allocates 150 words of dynamic memory (from the Hypo user dynamic
# memory) using Mem_alloc system call described in the MTOPS handout.
# It fills (sets) the allocated memory with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, …, 150.
# After setting the memory, the program frees the 150 words of dynamic memory
# using Mem_free system call described in the MTOPS handout. Then it halts.

# Instructions used:
# NAME      OP-CODE Description
# Halt      0       Halt execution
# Add       1       Op1 op1 + op2
# Subtract  2       Op1 op1 – op2
# Move      5       Op1 op2

# Branch on minus   7   If Op1 < 0 then PC next word of the instruction. 
#                       Op2 is not used.

# System Call       12  Op1 has system call ID as immediate operand. That is, 
#                       second word of the instruction has the system call 
#                       identifier.  Op2 is not used.

# Addressing modes used:
# 0 Invalid/not used    Mode digit is not used in the instruction
# 1 Register mode	The specified general purpose register contains the 
#                       operand value.

# 3 Auto-increment	Register content is incremented by 1 after fetching the 
#                       operand's address

# 5 Direct mode         Next word contains the address of the operand. 
#                       Operand value is in the main memory. A general purpose
#                       register is not used. Use PC to get the address.

# 6 Immediate mode      Next word contains the operand value. Operand value is
#                       in the main memory as part of the instruction.
#                       A general purpose register is not used.
#                       Address is in the program counter.
